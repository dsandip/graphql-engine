Custom Docker images or binary for Hasura GraphQL engine
========================================================

If you require custom Docker images for Hasura GraphQL engine because the default base image(*alpine*) is not compatible with your security scanning tool (`Anchore <https://anchore.com/>`_, `Sysdig Secure <https://sysdig.com/products/kubernetes-security/image-scanning/>`_, etc.) or you need a binary to run in a non-Docker environment, we can make them available via a support plan. 

To set up this support plan, please contact us using the form on `this page <https://hasura.io/contact-us/>`_ and mention the Linux flavor (*CentOS, Debian slim, etc.*) or the target architecture for the binary you'd be interested in.

A custom image will be made available for every stable release of GraphQL engine.
